    "\n",
    "Cancer has a huge impact on society across the world. Cancer statistics help us understand what happens in large groups of people and provide a big picture of the burden of cancer over all times (National Cancer Institution, 2018). This project makes use of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) to derive information such as how many people are diagnosed with cancer in a given year, the average age at diagnosis, and differences among groups defined by interested categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HINTS data collection program was created by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to monitor changes in the rapidly evolving field of health communication. It collects nationally representative data routinely about the American public's use of cancer-related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to build an easy-to-use SQL database to store and use the data collected by the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). In the process, we learned the structure of the survey data, modified and broke down the original dataset with over 300 variables, and developed a strategy for MySQL database design. In the end, the project also investigated several leading risk factors through MySQL queries for all types of cancers and especially for prostate cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, the project could help the audience understand the myths and true risk factors, and provide information to non-professionals in cancer care management.\n"

    "Each sections contain a few \"True/False\" questions, multiple choices questions, or multiple choices questions with a blank field to specify unmentioned choices. The answer to each questions are coded as differente categorical variables with number values representing different categories, e.g., 1 for Yes, 2 for No, -9 for missing data, etc. \n",
